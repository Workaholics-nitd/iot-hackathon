## Building

>Note that depending on your machine you may have to use **pip3** instead of **pip** and **python3** instead of **python**.


>Its best to use the `virtualenv` tool to build locally. Install virtualenv by running `pip install virtualenv`

>Then create a virtual environment by `virtualenv <your env name>`

>Activate the virtual environment by `source <your env name>/bin/activate`

>Deativate the virtual environment by running `deactivate` in your terminal.

 * First install the required modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 * Then run `python manage.py runserver <port no>`

 Go to `localhost:<port no>/datavis` and the site should be live!
